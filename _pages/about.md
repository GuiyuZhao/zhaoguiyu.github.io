I'm a currently third year master from [National Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned](https://csicdgz.bit.edu.cn/), [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/). 
I am advised by [Prof. Ma Hongbin](http://www.we-learn.net.cn/mathmhb/).
Before this, I received my Bachelor’s Degree, majoring in Automation, from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) in June 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Li Danyun](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/lidanyun/).
